All profile hmms utilized in Fischer et al., 2021: Metagenomic insights in anaerobic methylated compound metabolism in anoxic marine sediments 

All sulfur profile hmms are from TIGRfam, as are mttA; mtmB; mtdB; mttB and mttC and renamed for gene names. All other profile hmms are custom built using function hmmbuild of the HMMer suite v3.3 and manually curated databases of (predicted) genes, aligned using MAFFT v7.429.
